# MapP2P

MapP2P is an Android application that allows users to freely draw and place markers on a map generated using the Google Maps API.

Users can connect with other users using a peer-to-peer interface and form group sessions to draw together on the same map.

Each user can scale, translate, rotate, and tilt the map independently of other users, and all lines drawn will stay in the correct geographical locations.
